Graduated in Geology at Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho
(1995), Master in Stratigraphy and Sedimentation at Universidade Estadual
Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho (1998) and PhD in Sedimentary Basin Analysis
at Universidade Estadual Paulista (2003). He has experience in the area of
Geosciences, with an emphasis on Regional Geology, acting mainly on
the following themes: Basin Analysis, Continental Sequence Stratigraphic,
Sedimentology, Aquifer Systems and Geological Mapping. He was Adjunct Professor
in the Department of Geosciences at the Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL),
teaching General Geology and Earth System, Paleontology and Theory of
Evolution, Geosciences and Environment, between 2004 and 2005. He joined as a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in 2005,
where he taught the disciplines of Sedimentology (GE601), Stratigraphy (GE704)
and Tectonostratigraphic Evolution and Economic Potentiality of Brazilian
Intracratonic Basins (GE122), in addition to giving lectures and field work in
the disciplines of Field Geology II (Argentina and Piumhi-MG) (GE905) and
Geology of Energy Resources (GE705). He completed his post-doctorate with the
Department of Geology and Natural Resources of the University of Campinas
(DGRN-UNICAMP) in April 2007, in the area of Sedimentology and
Stratigraphy, where he developed research on depositional mechanisms and
architectures of the holocentric alluvial fan systems of arid climate, in San
Juan, in the west of Argentina, using the Bauru Basin deposits in Brazil as a
comparison model. From 2007 to 2010, he served as a PhD Professor at
Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP/Rio Claro), Faculdades Integradas
Einstein de Limeira (FIEL) and Escola de Engenharia de Piracicaba (EEP) in the
disciplines Geomorphology, General Geology, Engineering Geology, Mechanics of
Soils and Pedology. He is currently a full-time professor at the UNICAMP in the
disciplines Geology of Hydrocarbons, Brazilian Sedimentary Basins:
Tectonoestratigraphic Evolution and Economic Potentiality; Regional
stratigraphic analysis; Mineralogy; Field Geology 0, 1 and 3. He works as a
professor in the disciplines Seminaries, Petroleum Geology and Siliciclastic
Depositional Systems. Develops research in the area of sedimentology,
stratigraphy, basin analysis and petroleum geology in the postgraduate course
of the Institute of Geosciences and Sciences and Petroleum Engineering
